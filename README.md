# Nightingale TTS

## Project Goal

Port [Chatterbox TTS](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox) from Python/PyTorch to Swift/MLX with the goal of running entirely on iPhone.

## Overview

Chatterbox is a PyTorch-based text-to-speech system. This project aims to:

- Convert the PyTorch model architecture to MLX
- Implement the TTS pipeline in Swift
- Optimize for on-device inference on iOS devices
- Enable fully offline, privacy-preserving speech synthesis

## Status

Project initialization - development in progress.

## Requirements

- iOS device with Apple Silicon (A-series or M-series chip)
- Xcode for Swift development
- MLX framework for on-device machine learning

## Architecture

TBD - will document the model architecture and conversion process as development progresses.
